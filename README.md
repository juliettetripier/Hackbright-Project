Juliette Tripier (they/she) is a programmer with a background in both cognitive neuroscience and administrative/HR work. They have two great loves: working through delicate, complex logic puzzles and drawing cute, silly cartoons. Building a Flask application with a friendly egg mascot has proven to be the perfect marriage of these two things.
